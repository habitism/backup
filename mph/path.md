Paths are crucial for achieving motivation.

Synonyms for path include steps, methods, and milestones.

## Standards for Designing Paths

Path design should adhere to the SMART criteria:

- Specific: Paths should have clear standards.
- Measurable: Execution data should be measurable.
- Attainable: Paths should be achievable.
- Relevant: Paths should be relevant to the motivation.
- Time-bound: Paths should have a time limit for execution.

Suppose your motivation is to `become an English expert`.

Next, break down this motivation into several paths:

- Give an English self-introduction to a stranger once.
- Memorize 80 common English names.
- Introduce 20 classic English movies.

If you set a time limit for yourself while executing these paths, they all adhere to the SMART principles.

## Deliberate Practice

There is a difference between doing something and doing it well.

The execution of paths is sequential.

Let's take running as an example:

- Path 1: Run 5 kilometers in 30 minutes.
- Path 2: Run 10 kilometers in 60 minutes.

If you can barely complete Path 1, it means that the design of Path 1 is reasonable.

The question is: Can you then complete Path 2?

The answer is `no`.

You need to repeatedly execute Path 1 until you can complete it easily.

This repetitive process is deliberate practice.

Training is often tedious, but we can turn it into a habit.
