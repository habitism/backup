Human behavior is driven by motivation, which can be divided into intrinsic and extrinsic drives.

## Intrinsic Drive

Intrinsic drive stems from your internal needs, including emotional and physiological needs.

When you want to obtain something, you take actions to get it.

Synonyms for intrinsic drive include desires, curiosity, competitiveness, etc.

For example, if you want to participate in a marathon, this thought is your intrinsic drive. You will then look for reasonable explanations to support your drive, such as:

- What benefits does running bring?
- What are some real-life examples of running changing lives?
- How to train for running scientifically?
- These questions all revolve around the motivation "you want to participate in a marathon."

The process of finding answers is the process of pursuing your goal.

## Extrinsic Drive

Extrinsic drive comes from external demands on you.

As a member of society, you are inevitably driven by social factors.

Synonyms for extrinsic drive include responsibility, obligation, work, etc.

Extrinsic drive is closely related to the culture, customs, and norms of the society you live in.

To obtain something from society, you must give something in return.

For example, as a college student, completing your graduation project is your extrinsic drive.

As long as you want to get a college diploma, you must complete the graduation project.

Even if the graduation project conflicts with your personal wishes.

## Feasibility of Motivation

Intrinsic and extrinsic drives (motivation) are the roots of your actions.

Motivation is often emotional and vague, so we need to make it concrete.

For example, if you want to become an English expert, you need to consider:

- What are the standards for an English expert?
- How can you achieve these standards step by step?
- Do you have the ability to meet these standards?

If you try to answer these questions one by one, you are starting to make your motivation concrete.

The process of analyzing motivation is generally the same:

    A1-->A12(Path 2)
    A2-->A21(Path 3)
    A2-->A22(Path 4)
</pre>

Motivation will eventually be broken down into multiple paths, each of which is an actionable step, forming a pathway to achieving your motivation.
