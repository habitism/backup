Habits are the bridges between paths.

Synonyms for habit include personality, customs, and lifestyle.

## The Role of Habits

Habits are the inertia brought about by repetitive training.

Each training session familiarizes your body and brain with the entire training process.

Take piano playing as an example. 

Why can some people play the piano and sing at the same time?

Because they have spent a lot of time repeatedly practicing the piano, including finger techniques and sheet music. Through extensive repetitive practice, their brains and fingers gradually became familiar with the process, ultimately enabling them to play the piano without conscious thought.

If a particular path is difficult for you, you can develop corresponding habits by repeatedly practicing the path until you can navigate it with ease.

## Principles of Designing Habits

Habits should adhere to the SRC principles:

- Simple: The path should be simple.
- Reward: Rewards should be given upon completion.
- Cycle: The path should be executed periodically.

Suppose your motivation is to participate in a marathon.

You break down this motivation into several paths:

1. Run 3 kilometers in 18 minutes
2. Run 5 kilometers in 30 minutes
3. Run 10 kilometers in 60 minutes

If path 2 is challenging for you, you need to develop a running habit.

You can perform path 1 every other day since it is relatively simple.

Why do habits need rewards?

Because repetitive execution of a path is monotonous.

Sometimes, it is difficult to see results in the short term, so rewards are needed to help you persist.

## Setting Rewards

Relying on willpower to develop habits is mentally exhausting.

Rewards can help you restore willpower.

After completing a difficult path, you can allocate some time to relax:

- Play a game
- Watch a movie
- Eat at KFC

Note: Do not reward yourself in advance.
