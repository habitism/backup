If you feel aimless, disorganized, or wasting time, the MPH model may be helpful for you.

Achieving goals involves three elements:

- [Motivation](./mph/motivation)
- [Path](./mph/path)
- [Habit](./mph/habit)

If you are constantly frustrated, you are missing at least one of these elements.

Motivation explains the meaning of the goal. When people do something, they often need a reason, and this reason is usually not to convince others, but to convince themselves.

The Path is the breakdown of the goal, used to prove its feasibility. Once you have a goal, you need to do a simple assessment of it. In this process, you will gradually sort out an execution plan for the goal, which will involve multiple steps (paths). If each step is explainable, then the goal is achievable.

During the process of achieving a goal, you will encounter various setbacks. Habit is repeated training to overcome these setbacks. Each practice will enhance your ability, and your confidence will increase correspondingly until you overcome a difficult step.
